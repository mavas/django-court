# Test cases

This repository has exactly only the following purposes:

- This repository only has test cases
- The test cases are all based off of Django's test case mechanism(s) (www.djangoproject.com)
- All tests are run entirely and only with GitHub's "actions" mechanism(s) (https://github.com/features/actions)
