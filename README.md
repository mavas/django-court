# Test cases

This repository has exactly only the following purposes:

- Everything's based off of Django (www.DjangoProject.com)
- the main thing is Django's test case mechanism(s)
- ..those tests are run entirely and only with GitHub's "actions" mechanism(s) (https://github.com/features/actions)
