# Test cases

This repository has exactly only the following purposes:

- This repository only has test cases
- The test cases are all based off of Django's test case mechanism(s) (www.djangoproject.com)
- All tests are run entirely and only with GitHub's "actions" mechanism(s) (https://github.com/features/actions)

## Developer instructions

- This repository follows the https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/ .  So, there is the 'main' branch (which only contains software releases that are tagged), the 'develop' branch (which will contain all agreeable changes that will be in the next release), and 'feaure/blahblahblah' branches (for new features currently in development).
